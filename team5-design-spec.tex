\subsection{Actor Descriptions}
    \begin{description}
        \item[Local player] is the local user and has full
            access to the mouse and keyboard or touchscreen interface.
        \item[Online player] is a non-local player. There is two-way
            communication between this type of player and the local player.
            There may be 0 or more online players.
        \item[The Host] has special powers, may disconnect other players and
            block players from selecting different puzzles. This player could
            be Local or Online.
    \end{description}

\begin{mdframed}
    \subsubsection{Host match}
    \begin{description}
        \item[Entry conditions] Internet connection.

            \begin{enumerate}
                \item The user presses the appropriate menu button.
                \item User creates a game, selects number of players and game
                    type
                \item User shares (friendly looking) match ID with other

                \item Puzzle Selector appears.
                \item The user may configure the game with this screen.
                    This
                    entails choosing a puzzle and a game mode (edit or solve).
                    Other players can be prevented from making such
                    modifications.
                \item This Puzzle Selector will create a Puzzle Scene
