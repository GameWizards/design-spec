\section{Project Overview} % CA
Anttris is a unique and competitive three-dimensional puzzle game that can be played alone or against others online. The core of Anttris’ gameplay lies in solving various puzzle cubes that are composed of blocks. These puzzles vary from simple to complicated and require critical thinking to complete. Players solve these puzzle cubes by interacting with individual blocks until they are all destroyed.

Anttris includes two different game modes: single-player and competitive. Single-player focuses on clearing puzzles with an emphasis placed on efficiency of the solution which is measured by the amount of moves and total time. Competitive games shifts the focus to solving cubes faster than an opponent.

While the two core game modes provide a fun and unique game, Anttris really shines when it comes to the ability to create your own puzzles through a built-in editor. Players are also able to use the puzzles they created when playing competitively. The goal of the game is expanded from simply solving a cube faster than your opponent to \textsl{creating} a puzzle that will challenge your opponent while you solve their puzzle first.

\subsection{Actor Descriptions}
    \begin{description}
        \item[Local player] is the local user and has full
            access to the mouse and keyboard or touchscreen interface.
        \item[Online player] is a non-local player. There is two-way
            communication between this type of player and the local player.
            There may be 0 or more online players.
        \item[The Host] has special powers, may disconnect other players and
            block players from selecting different puzzles. This player could
            be Local or Online.
    \end{description}

    \subsubsection{Host match}
    \begin{description}
        \item[Entry conditions] Internet connection.
        \item[Exit conditions] Will return to game menu. All players
            disconnected or all puzzles have been solved.
        \item[Participating Actors] Online player and local player.
        \item[Flow of events]:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item The user presses the appropriate menu button.
                \item User creates a game, selects number of players and game
                    type
                \item User shares (friendly looking) match ID with other
                    players. These players may connect to the match
                \item Puzzle Selector appears.
                \item The user may configure the game with this screen.
                    This
                    entails choosing a puzzle and a game mode (edit or solve).
                    Other players can be prevented from making such
                    modifications.
                \item This Puzzle Selector will create a Puzzle Scene
                \item The scene will change from the main menu to the Puzzle
                    Scene.
                \item Additional view-ports will be added to the game screen. 
                These show the progress of online players in an interface
                similar to the local player's puzzle.

The two primary subsystems of Anttris are the puzzle-solving system and the online system.

The puzzle-solving system is composed generically over a puzzle viewer and attached event
handling that allows interaction with the puzzle. Both offline games and online ones use 
the puzzle viewer, as does the unique puzzle-editing mode. The puzzle viewer is used by
all three unique modes, and works with our 3D model interaction system to provide
interactivity. This system is built on the Godot 3d Engine, which uses OpenGL.

The online system breaks down immediately into host mode or remote client mode. The host 
mode interfaces with the application-generic session-host system, which works in conjunction
with the session lobby to facilitate remote clients to connect and play against the host. 
Remote clients also work closely with the session lobby to find hosts to play against. Both
the session lobby and the session-host system work with the Godot Online Subsystem to provide
connectivity. The Godot Online Subsystem is built over tcp-udp/ip.
